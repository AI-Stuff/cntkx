#### Mixture Density Network
Mixture density networks are neural networks that can in principle represent arbitrary conditional 
probability distributions in the same way that a conventional neural network can represent arbitrary functions.
MDN are very useful when you need to map an input to several correct targets (aka. one-to-many problem).

Updated with Gaussian Mixture Density Network ops and loss function. Ops will allow you to extract mdn coefficients and sample from the network.

More details on mdn can be found in this [paper](https://publications.aston.ac.uk/373/1/NCRG_94_004.pdf) by Christopher Bishop.
